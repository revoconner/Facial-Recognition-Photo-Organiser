# Sort by Faces
A program that recognises faces in all your photos, and groups them by faces, without changing the underlying file path or structure.

The photos stored in your computer are seldom stored by what people are in those photos. Users usually tend to group them into one folder, or organise them depending on dates or events. But what if you need to find all photos of a certain person, say you broke up with your ex and needs to delete all of their photos, or maybe you need to make a collage for your best friend's birthday. 

While there are tools that already do this, they all need some kind of internet connectivity and sends your data to some cloud (which is just a computer running in some datacenter). Now you can do this locally on your pc, with a great GUI program. And it doesn't even mess up the way you originally organised your photos.

## Features
- User friendly GUI
- Hide people from list
- Rename people
- Hide photos
- Preview photos or open them in your default photos app
- Hide people with less than X photos
- Change thumbnail for people's list
- Sort by name of number of photos
- Quickly jump to a person
- Finds new photos or deleted photos on disk autmatically
- Exclusion by wildcard or subfolder
- Doesn't change your folder structure, the faces only work inside the app and is kept in a separate database. So if you have organised your folders in a certain way, it won't mess with that.
- Lets user decide the threshold percentage, for facial matching
- Allocates system resources dynamically so as not to bog down your system.
